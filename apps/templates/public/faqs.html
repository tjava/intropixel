For final purchases in HD or even 4K we recommend uploading only high-resolution png files with transparent background. Of course you can experiment with uploading images or graphics as well, as long as they are PNG or JPG files. In any case the visual size of your logo will stay the same even if you upload a higher resolution of the same logo.</div>
